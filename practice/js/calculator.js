/*
 *   Using functions and all that you have learnt in the class today
 *   Write a program for a calculator
 *   We will call a function for each of the following operations
 *     - Addition         :     The Sum of a & b is: 16
 *     - Substraction     :     The Difference between a & b is: 26
 *     - Multiplication   :     The Product of a & b is: 963
 *     - Division         :     The Quotient of a & b is: 165892
 *     - Modulo           :     The Modulo of a & b is: 4
 *   The calling function will have 2 values for performing the above operations
